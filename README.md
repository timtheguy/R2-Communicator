# R2 Communicator
An Ionic 3 (beta) application that allows you to communicate with your own R2 unit.

## What is it?
*R2 Communicator* is an Ionic 3 mobile app, compatible with Android and iOS devices. Designed for the casual and dedicated Star Wars fan alike, this application allows users to learn more about the Star Wars galaxy by simulating interaction with an R2 unit.

It is built on the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) and was created for the Ionic [**Become an Ionic Jedi Hackster** hackathon](http://blog.ionic.io/become-an-ionic-jedi-hackster/) for Star Wars day, May 4th, 2017.

## How does it work?
The *R2 Communicator* app is built on the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) and allows the user to interact with the R2 unit by prompting the user for information about galactic ships, planets, species, and people. The R2 unit then chimes back with some information in any of the categories, and proudly displays an overview on the screen.
